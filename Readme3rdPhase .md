#### üìö Focus Areas
In this challenge, I will be diving deep into three key areas of mathematics essential for AI:

1. **Calculus**: Understanding derivatives, integrals, and optimization techniques for machine learning.
2. **Linear Algebra**: Exploring vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and their applications in AI algorithms.
3. **Probability & Statistics**: Learning probability theory, distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical methods to enhance data analysis and model evaluation.

#### ü§ù Join Me! Get Connected with me!
If anyone is interested in joining this journey and learning together, I‚Äôd love to team up! Let‚Äôs make our math skills stronger and dive deeper into the foundations of AI. Together, we can share resources, solve problems, and motivate each other to stay on track.
