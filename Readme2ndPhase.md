## 100 Days of Maths Challenge
### Powered By Nōrai | AI & Education
### Learning Today, Tomorrow, and Beyond!
Welcome to second phase of 100DaysOfMaths. Basic **Linear Algebra** and **Integration** are discussed and solved in this 2nd Phase.

#### 🚀 Challenge Start Date
**📅 Start Date**: 17th November 2024 (1st Mangsir, 2081)

### 🧮 Post will be uploaded only at twitter:

#### 📚 Focus Areas
In this challenge, I will be diving deep into three key areas of mathematics essential for AI:

1. **Calculus**: Understanding derivatives, integrals, and optimization techniques for machine learning.
2. **Linear Algebra**: Exploring vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and their applications in AI algorithms.
3. **Probability & Statistics**: Learning probability theory, distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical methods to enhance data analysis and model evaluation.

#### 🤝 Join Me! Get Connected with me!
If anyone is interested in joining this journey and learning together, I’d love to team up! Let’s make our math skills stronger and dive deeper into the foundations of AI. Together, we can share resources, solve problems, and motivate each other to stay on track.
