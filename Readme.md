## 100 Days of Maths Challenge
### Powered By N≈çrai | AI & Education
### Learning Today, Tomorrow, and Beyond!
Last year, I completed the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning Tutorial and successfully finished my **#100DaysOfLearning** journey. During this process, I strongly realized that **Mathematics is the true Backbone of AI**. To further strengthen my skills and build a solid foundation, I am starting the **#100DaysOfMaths** challenge.

#### üöÄ Challenge Start Date
**üìÖ Start Date**: 17th November 2024 (1st Mangsir, 2081)

### üßÆ Post will be uploaded only at twitter:

#### üìö Focus Areas
In this challenge, I will be diving deep into three key areas of mathematics essential for AI:

1. **Calculus**: Understanding derivatives, integrals, and optimization techniques for machine learning.
2. **Linear Algebra**: Exploring vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and their applications in AI algorithms.
3. **Probability & Statistics**: Learning probability theory, distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical methods to enhance data analysis and model evaluation.

#### ü§ù Join Me! Before 16 Nov, 2024
If anyone is interested in joining this journey and learning together, I‚Äôd love to team up! Let‚Äôs make our math skills stronger and dive deeper into the foundations of AI. Together, we can share resources, solve problems, and motivate each other to stay on track.
